# rpg-wallet

An wallet (originally meant to be used on tabletop RPG games) capable of arbitrary number of coin types and exchange values. Although it is working, there's not much error handling or some sort of defensive mechanism against bad user inputs.

Please install the python dependencies below manually, or from the requirements.txt:

```bash
pytest==6.2.4
persist-queue==0.6.0
```

Usage: just run RPGWallet.py and follow the instructions from there.
